This assumes you have web-dev-server installed.

If you don't, please run:
npm install web-dev-server

then run:
npm run start:dev

in the root directory of this project (hope this works)

then navigate to localhost:8080/patients (Or just click on
patients / appointments)

Anyways, how to read this code base:
- Start at index.tsx
- Then onto Routes.tsx, that's got navigation and the pages
- The pages directory contains each page

Let me know if you run into trouble running it, as I think this
is alright project.

This assumes you have web-dev-server installed.

If you don't, please run:
npm install web-dev-server --save-dev

then run:
npm start:dev

in the root directory of this project (hope this works)

then navigate to localhost:8080/patients (Or just click on
patients / appointments)

TBH I'm not sure why react router isn't redirecting, although
you can see what I attempted to do in Routes.tsx
